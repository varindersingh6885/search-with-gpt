# search-with-gpt

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of project descriptions. Create an application that can be used to perform a search over these descriptions. The search should support free-form queries such as `find the projects that use React Js in frontend and Python in backend`.

**Solution:**

Developed an application where I have integrated `ChatGPT` from `OpenAI` to pass the list of projects as a context. And then performing search queries as a prompt to ChatGPT to find the relevant projects.
